# Proyecto 1x1  

demo1.py  
Here we use the default Clarifai model to see what's on our URL images.  
  
demo2.py  
The same as demo1.py, but the code is more friendly to see and debug.  

training.py  
Create an special model for proyecto1x1.com  
Not pretty sure that it works. I need to test it again with more images and without breakpoints.  

predicting.py  
We're using the model created before and sending an image to see the result.  
It seems to work fine. But I need to verify.
